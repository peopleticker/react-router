For example, `0.4.1` and `0.4.8` will have the same API, but\n`0.5.0` will have breaking changes.\n\nPlease refer to the [upgrade guide](/UPGRADE_GUIDE.md) and\n[changelog](/CHANGELOG.md) when upgrading.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n```sh\nnpm install react-router\n# or\nbower install react-router\n```\n\nThis library is written with CommonJS modules. If you are using\nbrowserify, webpack, or similar, you can consume it like anything else\ninstalled from npm.\n\nThere is also a global build available on bower, find the library on\n`window.ReactRouter`.\n\nThe library is also available on the popular CDN [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/react-router).\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- Nested views mapped to nested routes\n- Modular construction of route hierarchy\n- Sync and async transition hooks\n- Transition abort / redirect / retry\n- Dynamic segments\n- Query parameters\n- Links with automatic `.active` class when their route is active\n- Multiple root routes\n- Hash or HTML5 history (with fallback) URLs\n- Declarative Redirect routes\n- Declarative NotFound routes\n- Browser scroll behavior with transitions\n\nCheck out the `examples` directory to see how simple previously complex UI\nand workflows are to create.\n\nWhat's it look like?\n--------------------\n\n```js\nvar routes = (\n  <Route handler={App} path=\"/\">\n    <DefaultRoute handler={Home} />\n    <Route name=\"about\" handler={About} />\n    <Route name=\"users\" handler={Users}>\n      <Route name=\"recent-users\" path=\"recent\" handler={RecentUsers} />\n      <Route name=\"user\" path=\"/user/:userId\" handler={User} />\n      <NotFoundRoute handler={UserRouteNotFound}/>\n    </Route>\n    <NotFoundRoute handler={NotFound}/>\n    <Redirect from=\"company\" to=\"about\" />\n  </Route>\n);\n\nRouter.run(routes, function (Handler) {\n  React.render(<Handler/>, document.body);\n});\n\n// Or, if you'd like to use the HTML5 history API for cleaner URLs:\n\nRouter.run(routes, Router.HistoryLocation, function (Handler) {\n  React.render(<Handler/>, document.body);\n});\n```\n\nSee more in the [overview guide](/docs/guides/overview.md).\n\nBenefits of this Approach\n-------------------------\n\n1. **Incredible screen-creation productivity** - There is only one\n   use-case when a user visits a route: render something. Every user\n   interface has layers (or nesting) whether it's a simple navbar or\n   multiple levels of master-detail. Coupling nested routes to these\n   nested views gets rid of a ton of work for the developer to wire all\n   of it together when the user switches routes. Adding new screens\n   could not get faster.\n\n2. **Immediate understanding of application structure** - When routes\n   are declared in one place, developers can easily construct a mental\n   image of the application. It's essentially a sitemap. There's not a\n   better way to get so much information about your app this quickly.\n\n3. **Code tractability** - When a developer gets a ticket to fix a bug\n   at as specific url they simply 1) look at the route config, then 2)\n   go find the handler for that route. Every entry point into your\n   application is represented by these routes.\n\n4. **URLs are your first thought, not an after-thought** - With React\n   Router, you don't get UI on the page without configuring a url first.\n   Fortunately, it's wildly productive this way, too.\n\nRelated Modules\n---------------\n\n- [rnr-constrained-route](https://github.com/bjyoungblood/rnr-constrained-route) - validate paths\n  and parameters on route handlers.\n- [react-router-bootstrap](https://github.com/mtscout6/react-router-bootstrap) - Integration with [react-bootstrap](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap) components.\n- [react-router-proxy-loader](https://github.com/odysseyscience/react-router-proxy-loader) - A Webpack loader to dynamically load react-router components on-demand\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nThanks, Ember\n-------------\n\nThis library is highly inspired by the Ember.js routing API. In general,\nit's a translation of the Ember router api to React. Huge thanks to the\nEmber team for solving the hardest part already.\n",
